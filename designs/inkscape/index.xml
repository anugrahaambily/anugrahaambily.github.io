      <description>This was designed as a TOC for a paper on &#39; Electrochemically derived functionalized graphene for bulk production of Hydrogen Peroxide&amp;rsquo;. Oxidized graphitic carbon-based materials have been recently proposed as an alternative to metal-based catalysts in the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and in this work we unravel the role of C=O groups in graphene towards sustainable peroxide formation</description>
