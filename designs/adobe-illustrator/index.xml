      <description>Designed for the official student magazine of IISER-M , Manthan ( August edition)
&amp;quot; Drug resistance imposes huge costs on health systems and is taking a growing-and unnecessary-toll in lives and threatening to roll back much of the progress we have made&amp;rdquo; - Ban Ki-moon
What is antibiotic resistance? How does one develop antibiotic resistance?
Do you remember taking an Amoxicillin pill for the very first time, and how better you felt in an hour?</description>

      <description>Please click here to watch the video
This work is my first try with comics and video. In this project we developed a system which produces Hydrogen Peroxide through Oxygen Reduction Reaction. We used this system for waste water treatment where contaminants with long Carbon chains were broken down and the COD was found to reduce after treatment.</description>

      <description>This work was prepared as cover for the official website of a PhD student at Queen&amp;rsquo;s Mary University, London. His work is mainly focused on audio processing. Imagine you are standing in the middle of a street in a city. close your eyes= what do you hear? Perhaps car..bus..footsteps..beeps&amp;hellip;human speech&amp;hellip;music &amp;hellip; siren..??Your sense of hearing tells you what is happening around you, without any sense of vision, right?! How do computers/mobile gadgets make sense of these urban sounds - &amp;ldquo;machine listening&amp;rdquo; and then how could we make use of machine listening.</description>

      <description>This work was done to participate in the Insa - SERB Science image and film competition, where the topic was &#39; Science through my eyes&amp;rsquo;. Science connects a wide variety of fields and continents through various discoveries. Science is an answer to the never ending mysteries. It has always been the ultimate solution to any problems and is a superhero who serves the world. From fire to most recent discoveries in artificial intelligence, it has always made our life simpler.</description>
