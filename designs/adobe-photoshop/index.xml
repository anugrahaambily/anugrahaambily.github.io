      <description>This work was done as a schematic representation for &amp;lsquo;3D printing of bio-inspired porous graphene based composite reinforced with Cu based catalyst for CO2 conversion.&amp;rsquo; In the current project, graphene as well as graphene-hexagonal boron nitride based structurally reinforced composite will be printed into the porous blocks with low density, high strength, and high surface area architecture, which can be used as template for embedding Cu based catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction process</description>
