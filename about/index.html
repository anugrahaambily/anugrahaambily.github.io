  <p><p>Hi üëã</p>
<p>I graduated with an integrated MSc, Physics. Immediately after my graduation, I joined as a junior research fellow at TIFR, Hyderabad. I had been working on the development of functional coatings for energy and environment related applications. During my project period, as a part of an outreach program, I volunteered to take classes for school students which made me interested in science communication. From my classroom experiences I felt that somewhere there is a gap in conveying science to students and the general audience without wiping out their creativity and eagerness. I have always wanted to do something out of my creativity which indeed gave me more satisfaction and happiness. And when I searched for a job where I can be creative and I can also engage in science communication, I found that scientific illustration is one such amazing field. So, along with my work, I started doing some illustrations for works going on in our lab, which gave me a feel about the field. Later I did some courses on graphic design and on some softwares for 3D modelling. Now I have started taking projects as a freelancer.Now, I am so excited that, by being an illustrator, I can learn a lot about different fields and projects and communicate it to many. If you guys feel that I can help you with any of your projects, then feel free to contact me.</p>
